# Arpadica

Back in September I started working on a little RTS project in Raylib. I sadly did not get very far with it, but as Siege is ending, I took this as a perfect opportunity to have another shot at it with the new knowledge and experience I gathered during this event. <br>
While the game is still not even nearly finished (still at the countries stage, soldiers and attacking coming around 0.5.0 probably), it already has some pretty cool features like: 

- Fully 3D map
- Pannable, zoomable and rotatable 3D camera
- Multiple country support

With loadable scenarios, soldiers and attacking coming very soon! (Probably the week that I'm writing this)


Some videos showcasing the interactive 3D map:

## Controls
- Right mouse button to pan around the map
- Middle mouse button to get info about the province (name)
- Left click to paint a province (this will later become the country feature)
- Arrow keys to tilt camera
- `R` to reset camera rotation

## How to build
If you have G++ set up on your computer, than building the project should be as simple as just typing in `make`. If you use Windows, you should use the `Makefile` while on Linux you should use `Makefile.linux`.
